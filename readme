This project is being developed as an educational exercise to learn how to emulate the Sega Master System and how the internals
of the console work.

Usage:

Provide a path to a ROM File name as a command line parameter when launching on the command line.
(e.g './MasterNostalgia "roms/zexall.sms"', or drag a ROM file onto the emulator's executable using your operating system's file manager)

Default controls:

Control pad 1 button 1: A
Control pad 1 button 2: S
Control pad 1 d-pad: Arrow keys
Pause: P
Quit: ESC

The default controls and video display settings can be customised/configured in the config.json file in the same directory
as the emulator's executable, the emulator will create one with the default values if one does not exist.

Compiling/building:

Requires the SFML 2.5.1 library to be installed on your system compiled for your C++ compiler (https://www.sfml-dev.org/), SFML
has pre-built binaries for some compiler versions, you can also choose to compile it yourself or install it through your
Linux distribution's package manager (or Homebrew on macOS). Please see their website for more details.

Also requires CMake (https://cmake.org/), this can usually be installed through your operating system's package manager.

Once your system has the above packages installed, the following terminal commands should build the project:

cd (directory where MasterNostalgia was cloned into)
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make

(Replace "make" with mingw32-make if using MinGW to build on Windows.)

VDP implementation are heavily influenced by this):

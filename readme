This project is being developed as an educational exercise to learn how to emulate the Sega Master System and how the internals
of the console work.

The emulator is not yet capable of running games as the emulator is still incomplete and needs work, but some ROMs do
display an image on screen. I am currently using the following program to test and debug the emulator:

Throughout this project I am using the following sources throughout development:

- Z80 Instruction Set & flag behaviour
https://clrhome.org/table/
http://z80-heaven.wikidot.com/instructions-set
http://www.z80.info/zip/z80-documented.pdf

- Emulator development information and code examples (Parts of the project, mostly memory/mapping code and the current
VDP implementation are heavily influenced by this):
http://www.codeslinger.co.uk/pages/projects/mastersystem/hardware.html (and other pages in the Master System section on here)
